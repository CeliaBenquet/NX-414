**1. Week 6: Linear models and Task-driven models.**
You will find the content of our work in the corresponding folder. We completed the notebook ```week6.ipynb```. You should be able to re-run the whole notebook but note that the second part would take some time and memory to run.

**2. Week 7: Data-driven models.**
You will find the content of our work in the corresponding folder. Most of the work was coded in ``.py`` files and the code we added to the notebook only corresponds to how you would run one model. We performed grid-search on the learning rate and only showing how to run the models we presented in the report. The models are defined in ```models.py``` and trained and evaluated in ```fit_models.py``` into a class ```Session```. 

**3. Week 9: Exploration.**
The content of our work can be found in the corresponding folder. 
- The jupyter notebook ```task_driven.ipynb``` contains our investigation related to task-driven models.
- The jupyter notebook ```data_driven.ipynb``` contains our investigation related to data-driven models.
The jupyter notebook ```hybrid.ipynb``` contains our investigation related to our hybrid architecture model.

**4. Report**
Our 1-page report is in the main folder: ```mini_project.pdf```.

**5. Best model evaluation***
A ```test.ipynb``` is available to evaluate our best performing model, in the main folder. To run it, you should be able to just run the whole notebook.
